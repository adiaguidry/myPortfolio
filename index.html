                   <h1>How I discovered Web Development</h1>
                   <p>I've always enjoyed creating, painting, sewing, decorating and then I became a mother and created my greatest masterpieces! (I know cheesy, but true!) My love for creating, seemed to grow from there. And it was during my husbands 3rd deployment when I found myself with a need to keep my mind occupied. I started a small online business and setting up my website fascinated me. In my aim to understand,  threw myself into learning to code. I wanted to understand it! For a year I dedicated my time, and energy into teaching myself to code. After grasping the basics of HTML, CSS basic concepts in JS I hit a wall. Thats when I found Learning Fuze, a full immersion Web development BootCamp! For 12 weeks and some 12 hour days I learned from lead developers! Every day I looked forward to my commute, diving into code, solving problems, collaberating with other programers, and being creative!

                <h4 class="col-md-offset-1 col-md-10">My final project was inspired by my six year old son, Noah. I wanted to teach him how to set goals for himself
                and I also wanted to teach him the value of a dollar. I thought it would be awesome to combined the two.
                After learning a bit of AngularJS I could see how two way data binding would be great for
                this project. As goals were being established by Noah, I would see those goals in the Admin interface, and they
                are listed for him to see on his interface. As he completes his goal he hits a button and I am notified. I
                decide how much he is paid for a job well done. I pay him through virtual money. That money is allocated to accounts, that
                are set up in admin, however he get to drag and drop to the account of his choice.</h4>

                The other side tracks the kids goals. When goals are made they show up there. When they are completed you select an
                amount to pay them. The total increase until you hit payday!</p>
