            <p>I've always enjoyed creating, painting, sewing, decorating and then I became a mother and created my
                greatest masterpieces! (I know cheesy, but true!) My love for creating, seemed to grow from there. And
                it was during my husbands 3rd deployment when I found myself with a need to keep my mind occupied. I
                started a small online business and setting up my website fascinated me. In my aim to understand, threw
                myself into learning to code. I wanted to understand it! For a year I dedicated my time, and energy into
                teaching myself to code. After grasping the basics of HTML, CSS basic concepts in JS I hit a wall. Thats
                when I found Learning Fuze, a full immersion Web development BootCamp! For 12 weeks and some 12 hour
                days I learned from lead developers! Every day I looked forward to my commute, diving into code, solving
                problems, collaberating with other programers, and being creative!

            <h4 class="col-md-offset-1 col-md-10">My final project was inspired by my six year old son, Noah. I also
                wanted build something with my new knowledge of AngularJS. I knew building this project would help me
                build on what I have learned. My project is intended to teach Noah how to set goals for himself
                and I also wanted to teach him the value of a dollar. I thought it would be awesome to combined the two.
                Understanding the use of Angular two way data binding I could see how the benefits would be great for
                this project. As goals were being established by Noah, I would see those goals in the Admin interface,
                and they
                are listed for him to see on his interface. As he completes his goal he hits a button and I am notified.
                I
                decide how much he is paid for a job well done. I pay him through virtual money. That money is allocated
                to accounts, that
                are set up in admin, however he get to drag and drop to the account of his choice.</h4>

                    The right side tracks the goals that are set by the kid. When goals are made they show up there.
                    When they are

                    you select an
